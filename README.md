# Beard-Combing-Robot
Santa's Beard Combing Robot

There is a robot for almost everything.
But there is no robot to comb the beard. That's why I made one.
And since Christmas is near, I tested it on Santa's beard.

stuff you need for this project: an Arduino , two servo motors , a Comb and one Santa clause.
you can see servo motors almost at any robotic project.
In this project, I also used two servo motors. And I attached one of them to the a comb for combing.
And I used another one to move the comb up and down.
You can change the amount of movement of servo motors in the code. And use this robot to comb your hair.
